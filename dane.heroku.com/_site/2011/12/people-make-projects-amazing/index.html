        <article><p>We have many amazing open source projects today, but none of them were
just amazing overnight and none of them would be considered amazing
without the people that have and do contribute to them. Projects
themselves are good ideas, but its the people behind them that make
them amazing.</p>

<h2>It Takes One Bad Experience</h2>

<p>It's not easy to get people contributing to an open source project, but
it's really easy to make sure they <em>don't</em>. When new people try to get
involved with a project they're excited and eager to participate.
Contacting a mailing list, commenting on a blog post or sending a pull
request is the start of a conversation between the project developers
and a potential contributor.</p>

<p>Not all opinions or code offered fit a project or the direction a
project wants to go in. That's okay, but how this message is relayed
makes all the difference in the world.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text">Newcomer: This project is awesome, but this feature would make it better!
Project Developer: No. Bad idea.
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>This is a terrible response. It's not helpful whatsoever and it will
leave the newcomer with a bad taste of the project. He or she may
continue to use the project, but good luck getting any type of help from
this person down the road.</p>

<p>If the feature (eg: a suggestion or code offered) doesn't fit the direction
of the project explain why. If the feature has been declined in the past
point the user to the thread. Help them get to where you are.</p>

<p>Here's a better response.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text">Newcomer: This project is awesome, but this feature would make it better!
Project Developer: Glad you like it. We actually have history with this feature
                   request checkout the thread at http://...
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>The thread may delcine the feature request, but it sheds light on why
and shares any meaningful conversations held on the topic. It's helpful,
educational and steers any future viewers to the same conclusion. It's a
huge win!</p>

<h2>Great Goes a Long Way</h2>

<p>When I think of amazing projects I think of the great people that have
brought them there. Immediately I think of <a href="http://rubini.us">Rubinius</a>, <a href="http://sass-lang.com">Sass</a> and
<a href="http://compass-style.org">Compass</a> just to name a few.</p>

<p>All three projects are great ideas, but the people that put their time
into the projects really make them amazing.</p>

<p>Recently I've been working on <a href="http://rubini.us">Rubinius</a> and it's been a wonderful
experience. My first pull request had working/passing code, but it
wasn't quite as they thought it should be. Sergey Nartimov (<a href="https://github.com/lest">lest</a>)
and Brian Ford (<a href="http://twitter.com/brixen">@brixen</a>) gave input and better code suggestions to
help bring my code up to par. With changes applied and commits squashed
the request was merged in.</p>

<p>It was a great first experience to the Rubinius project and I was excited
to do more. Because the team took the time to help me understand what
they were looking for, the next three pull requests were merged without a
problem.</p>

<p>When I started approaching more challenging areas of Ruby's feature set
I needed help so I jumped back into IRC where Brian Ford and Evan Phoenix
(<a href="http://twitter.com/evanphx">@evanphx</a>) continued to extremely helpful. From looking at code
with me, sending links to MSpec documentation, or filling out more
RubySpecs, they've been doing what they can to make my time coding
amazing.</p>

<p>It's experiences like this, I believe,  that make a project amazing. And
it's the people that make the experience.</p>

<p>It started out with suggestions on a pull request and now I encourage
my friends to try Rubinius, show them how easy it is to contribute and
I'm writing about it now. A great experience really does go a long way.</p>

    <p>Hi my name is Dane Harrigan. I'm a Heroku engineer working on their API team.
I'm a Rubyist by choice and trade, but I also enjoy working with Go in my spare
time. If I'm not hacking on something you'll find me dancing, pretending to know
what I'm doing on a guitar or playing a video game on easy mode.
