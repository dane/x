    <article><p>Choosing an API versioning strategy can be difficult. There are many approaches and
each come with their own pros and cons. Two of the most common practices are to version
in the URL or with headers.  For Heroku's public API we decided to version with the
<code>Accept</code> header.</p>

    <article><p>We have many amazing open source projects today, but none of them were
just amazing overnight and none of them would be considered amazing
without the people that have and do contribute to them. Projects
themselves are good ideas, but its the people behind them that make
them amazing.</p>

    <article><p>This is a follow up post to <a href="/2010/06/rake-tasks-101">Rake Tasks 101</a>. In the 101 post we
created Rake tasks, setup dependencies and made our tasks reusable by
passing in parameters. In Rake Tasks 102 we'll be building on those
practices, interfacing with a Rails environment and leveraging the cron
to automate our Rake task.</p>

    <article><p>I've been working with Rake quite a bit on my current project so I
thought I'd share some beginner tips.</p>

<p>Before I go into Rake, what is it? Rake is a Ruby-based build program.
Ruby on Rails uses Rake quite a bit in it's process. If you've worked on
a Rails project you'll used one, some or all of the following: rake
db:create, rake gems:unpack, rake db:migrate, and  rake test. Now that's
not all of Rail's Rake tasks, just some common ones.</p>

<p>You're here to make your own Rake tasks so lets get started!</p>

    <p>Hi my name is Dane Harrigan. I'm a Heroku engineer working on their API team.
I'm a Rubyist by choice and trade, but I also enjoy working with Go in my spare
time. If I'm not hacking on something you'll find me dancing, pretending to know
what I'm doing on a guitar or playing a video game on easy mode.
